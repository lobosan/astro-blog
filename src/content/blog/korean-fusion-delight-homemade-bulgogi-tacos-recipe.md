**For the Tacos**

- 8 small flour or corn tortillas

- 1 cup shredded lettuce

- 1 cup diced tomatoes

- 1/2 cup thinly sliced red onions

- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped

## **Instructions**

**1\. Marinate the Beef**

- In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, mirin, and crushed red pepper flakes.

- Place the thinly sliced beef in a resealable plastic bag or shallow dish.

**2\. Cook the Bulgogi**

- Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.

- Cook the marinated beef slices for 2-3 minutes per side or until they develop a beautiful caramelized exterior and are cooked to your preferred level of doneness.

- Pour the remaining marinade over the beef during the last minute of cooking, allowing it to create a flavorful glaze.

**3\. Prepare the Toppings**

- While the bulgogi is cooking, chop and prepare your taco toppings.

- Shred lettuce, dice tomatoes, slice red onions, and chop fresh cilantro.

**4\. Warm the Tortillas**

- Heat the tortillas in a dry skillet or on a griddle for about 30 seconds per side, or until they are pliable and slightly browned.

**5\. Assemble the Tacos**

- Lay out the warm tortillas.

- Place a generous portion of bulgogi in the center of each tortilla.

- Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced red onions, and fresh cilantro.

**6\. Serve and Enjoy**
