Microbreweries have been popping up all over Toronto and people can't get enough. They offer a wonderful atmosphere as well as refreshing beer and great eats. If you haven't visited a microbrewery in Toronto yet, what are you waiting for? Most areas of the city offer a number of different options, and we've compiled some of our favourties below:

### Henderson Brewing

Find yourself riding the Railpath or making a visit to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Henderson Brewing is right around the corner and ready to serve you a cold refreshing brew. Best known for Henderson's Best Amber Ale, the brewery is also home to around a dozen seasonal collaborations, like the Nordic Ale - Infused with Scandinavian Angelica Root, renowned for its restorative properties and once said to be the currency of Vikings. Best of all, they allow dogs in the taproom, so stop by and have a pint with your pooch!

### Amsterdam Brewhouse

With a tremendous amount of seating for over 1,000 guests and multiple patios on site, Amsterdam BrewHouse is easily one of Ontario’s largest taprooms. Situated right on Toronto's Waterfront, the brewhouse offers spectacular views of Lake Ontario and its proximity to the CN Tower also make a very popular place for locals and tourists alike.

### Northern Maverick

### **Kensington Brewing Co.**

There are plenty of options when you're looking to grab a pint in Kensington Market, but this is the only location where the beer flows right from the tanks. Open since 2017, the KBC’s taproom features 40 seats divided between stools at the bar and communal benches.

### **Bandit Brewery**

Inspired by German beer gardens, and situated in Dundas West, this brewery features a spacious outdoor patio, with picnic tables and trees. Owners Stephane Dubois and Shehzad Hamza created a very cozy atmosphere for sampling the microbrewery’s range of beers and delicious eats.
